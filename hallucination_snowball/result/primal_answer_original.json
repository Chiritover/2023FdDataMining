}{
    "question": "Is 12503 a prime number?",
    "answer": "To determine whether 12503 is a prime number or not, we need to test if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. The first and easiest way to test for prime numbers is to divide it by all the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the number we're testing. If none of these primes divide the number, then the number is prime. The square root of 12503 is approximately 111.83, so we only need to test primes up to 111.2 does not divide 12503. 3 does not divide 12503. 5 does not divide 12503. 7 does not divide 12503. 11 does not divide 12503. 13 does not divide 12503. We can continue testing primes up to 111, but we can see that none of the primes we've tested so far divide 12503. Therefore, we can conclude that 12503 is a prime number. So, yes, 12503 is a prime number."

    "question": "Is 7927 a prime number?",
    "answer": "There are different methods to determine whether a number is prime, but one common approach is to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.. In this case, we can start by checking the divisibility of 7927 by the first few prime numbers. - 2: 7927 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2. - 3: The sum of the digits of 7927 is 25, which is not divisible by 3, so 7927 is not divisible by 3. - 5: 7927 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. - 7: We can use a divisibility rule for 7 based on alternating digits: take the ones digit (7) and double it to get 14; subtract this from the truncated number 792 (which represents the tens and hundreds digits), giving 678; double the ones digit of this (8) to get 16; subtract this from the truncated number 67, giving 51; since 51 is not divisible by 7, neither is 7927. We could continue checking more prime numbers, but since 7927 has not been found to be divisible by any of the primes up to \u221a7927 \u2248 89.02, we can conclude that it is a prime number. Therefore, the answer is. 7927 is a prime number."
